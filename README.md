# NBA Viewership Analysis — BYOD Project

**Author:** Cassius Garcia  
**Course:** Data Science / Final Assignment  
**Notebook:** `SemesterProject.ipynb`

## Project Goal

This project investigates the *decline in NBA Finals TV ratings* and challenges the assumption that it means the league itself is in decline. We explore:

- How the **style of play** (e.g. pace, eFG%) has evolved over the decades
- How **global growth** and **digital platforms** are reshaping NBA engagement
- Why **traditional TV ratings no longer reflect actual fandom**
- The role of **piracy, League Pass blackouts**, and **fan demographics**

## Data Sources

All data used in this project is available in this repository:
- NBA Finals box scores (1981, 1998, 2008, 2016, 2024)
- Viewership data from Statista & Sports Media Watch
- Piracy behavior by age group (Guardian, Irdeto)
- Cable decline vs. digital growth trends
- Custom CSVs for League Pass blackout example

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control and reproducibility

## How to Run

1. Open `SemesterProject.ipynb` in JupyterLab or VS Code.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. All data is loaded via public GitHub URLs — no downloads needed.

## Notes

This project was submitted as part of the "Bring Your Own Data" final assignment.  
It reflects my passion for basketball and a desire to dig deeper into what the numbers actually mean for the NBA in the modern media landscape.
